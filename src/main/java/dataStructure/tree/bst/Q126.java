* 126. Word Ladder II [hard]
* https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder-ii/
* A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList
* is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:
*   Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
*   Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
*   sk == endWord
*
* Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList,
* return all the shortest transformation sequences from beginWord to endWord, or an empty list if no such sequence exists.
* Each sequence should be returned as a list of the words [beginWord, s1, s2, ..., sk].
